# Finding duplicate files

## Task 1 - Odds of collision

With two bits, there are 4 possible values. The chance of not colliding is therefore 75% for the first two files. Then, 0.75^2 for three files and 0.75^3 for four files, which is 0.42, therefore the odds of colliding are 58%.

## Task 2 - Streaming I/O

_A streaming API delivers data one piece at a time rather than all at once. Read the documentation for the update method of hashing objects in Pythonâ€™s hashing module and rewrite the duplicate finder from this chapter to use it._

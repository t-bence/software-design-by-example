# Finding duplicate files

## Task 1 - Odds of collision

With two bits, there are 4 possible values. The chance of not colliding is therefore 75% for the first two files. Then, 0.75^2 for three files and 0.75^3 for four files, which is 0.42, therefore the odds of colliding are 58%.

## Task 2 - Streaming I/O

_A streaming API delivers data one piece at a time rather than all at once. Read the documentation for the update method of hashing objects in Pythonâ€™s hashing module and rewrite the duplicate finder from this chapter to use it._

This was really simple.

## Task 3 - Big Oh

That case is N(N-1), so effectively O(N^2).

## Task 4 - `hash` function

It cannot hash mutable values, that is why it fails for `hash([1, 2, 3])`.

## Task 5 - How good is SHA-256?

1. Write a function that calculates the SHA-256 hash code of each unique line of a text file.
1. Convert the hex digests of those hash codes to integers.
1. Plot a histogram of those integer values with 20 bins.
1. How evenly distributed are the hash codes? How does the distribution change as you process larger files?

I will do this in another file, `plotting_sha.py`.

Looks simple, but now the plotting fails because the numbers are too large. So, I added modulo 1_000_000 to that.
